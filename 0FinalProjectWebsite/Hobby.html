          My hobby is painting, and I have been interested in art for as long as
          I can remember. I love the feeling of creativity and expression that
          comes with putting brush to canvas, and I find painting to be a very
          therapeutic and relaxing activity. I enjoy experimenting with
          different styles and techniques, and I am constantly trying to improve
          my skills and push my boundaries as an artist. I am particularly drawn
          to abstract and impressionist styles, and I love to use bold colors
          and brushstrokes to create unique and expressive pieces. Some of my
          paintings are given below:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="blog-image"
            src="images/art1.jpg"
            alt="A soul finally resting in peace"
          />
          <img
            class="blog-image"
            src="images/art2.jpg"
            alt="A girl staring from a prison"
          />
        </figure>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <p class="content_text">
          In addition to painting, I also enjoy watching sunsets and listening
          to music. I find the colors and beauty of a sunset to be incredibly
          inspiring, and I often use these colors and moods as inspiration for
          my paintings. I also love to listen to music, and I am a big fan of
          the South Korean band BTS. Their music is upbeat and energetic, and it
          always puts me in a good mood.

        I absolutely love BTS! They are my favorite band and I am a huge fan of
        their music and personalities. I have been listening to their songs for
        years and they never fail to put a smile on my face. I love their
        energetic performances and the way they incorporate different styles and
        sounds into their music. I also admire their dedication to their fans
        and the way they use their platform to promote positivity and social
        issues. BTS has had a huge impact on my life and I am grateful for the
        joy and inspiration they bring. I will always be an ARMY and support
        them in all that they do.Overall, my hobby of painting, watching
        sunsets, and listening to BTS music brings me a great deal of joy and
        fulfillment. It allows me to express myself creatively and connect with
        the world around me in a meaningful way. I am grateful to have these
        interests and passions in my life, and I look forward to continuing to
        explore and develop them in the future.
