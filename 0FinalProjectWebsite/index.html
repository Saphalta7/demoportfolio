          Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Saphalta Kumal and I am a

          individual who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities
          to learn and grow. I have a passion for technology and love to explore
          the latest advancements in the field. In my free time, I enjoy reading

          I grew up in a small town and was always interested in how things
          worked and how I could make them better. This curiosity led me to
          pursue a degree in computer science, where I am lerning a wide range
          of skills, including coding, algorithm design, and problem-solving.
          After graduating, I'll start working as a software engineer, where
          I'll be able to apply my knowledge and skills to build complex and
          innovative systems.I am also actively involved in the tech community.
          I attend conferences and workshops, where I learn about the latest
          trends and developments in the field. I also enjoy sharing my
          knowledge and experience with others
