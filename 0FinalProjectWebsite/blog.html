          Jujutsu Kaisen is a popular Japanese anime series that first premiered
          in October 2020. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori,
          who becomes involved in the world of "jujutsu sorcerers" who use
          magical powers to fight against evil spirits known as "curses." After
          his grandfather, a renowned jujutsu sorcerer, passes away, Yuji
          inherits his powers and is tasked with defeating the powerful curses
          that threaten humanity. Along the way, he meets and teams up with
          other jujutsu sorcerers, including the talented but arrogant Satoru
          Gojo, the demon sword specialist Megumi Fushiguro, and the cursed
          maiden Nobara Kugisaki. As Yuji and his allies face off against a
          variety of curses, they must also deal with their own personal
          struggles and the conflicts that arise within their group. The anime
          explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the cost of using powerful
          magic. With its engaging characters, thrilling action, and emotional
          storytelling, Jujutsu Kaisen has become a hit with anime fans and has
          gained a loyal following around the world. Its first season ended in
          March 2021, and a second season is currently in development.
